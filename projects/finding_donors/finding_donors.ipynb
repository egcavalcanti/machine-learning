    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had 100 text messages where only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score (we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the problem has a mixture of continuous and discrete features, and a binary label.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Decision Trees**\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "One real-world application was exemplified in the lectures, with the problem of recommending apps to customers based on some information about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are simple to understand and to interpret, as we can easily visualise the rules by the structure of the tree. This also means it is easy to understand what went wrong when a model fails, as well as to explain its success; It requires little data preparation such as normalisation; prediction runtime is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree, i.e. efficient; it can handle both numerical and categorical data; it is possible to statistically validate the model, and thus to determine its reliability. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "They have a tendency to overfit, although it can be parametrised to avoid this problem; it is a hard problem (NP-complete) to learn an optimal decision tree, and therefore practical algorithms use heuristics that are not guaranteed to be optimal; some functions are hard to learn using decision trees; it doesn't support online learning. [1, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "It suits the fact that we have a classification problem where the data has discrete and continuous features. It is also handy for this particular problem where we later want to do some feature importance analysis. The fact that it doesn't support online learning is irrelevant in this case as all the processing is done offline. The dataset isn't enormous, so the inefficiency of Decision Trees shouldn't be an issue. It is quite possible however that it will tend to overfit the data, and so I will use ensemble methods in combination with decision trees below to attempt to mitigate this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Ensemble Methods (Random Forest)**\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all classifiers, applications are endless, but one real-world application is machine fault diagnosis [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests have similar strengths as decision trees, with the added strength that it minimises the tendency to overfit by adding randomness in the process, through generating multiple random trees and averaging over their predictions. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are not as easily to visually interpret as a bare decision tree, since multiple trees are contributing to the final result with different weights. [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "All the same reasons for using decision trees, with the added strength of reducing overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Support Vector Machines (SVC)**\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs find many applications in classification problems such as text categorisation, image classification and character recognition. [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can provide high accuracy, can avoid overfitting well and can work when data isn't linearly separable in the feature space, given an appropriate kernel. Good with very high-dimensional feature spaces. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is memory intensive, hard to interpret, and it has too many parameters to tune. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "It works well with high-dimensional spaces, which is our case after one-hot encoding. Although on the other hand the dimensions here are perhaps much smaller than typical dimensionality found e.g. in character recognition problems, where SVMs are popular, so it may not be a great advantage in our case.\n",

It provided the highest F score for the testing set when 100% and 10% and 1% of the training set was used. Its runtime was larger than that of the Decision Tree classifier, but much smaller than that of SVC, both for training and predicting. However, the runtime was still sufficiently fast that it is not an issue for this problem, as it doesn't require online decisions to be made. Random Forests is a suitable algorithm for this data composed of both discrete and continuous features, and it provides feature importance analysis, which will be useful for this problem."

    "**Answer: ** The Random Forests classifier builds upon the Decision Trees classifier to resolve the latter's issues with overfitting. Decision Trees work by looking at possible splits of the dataset based on some of the features, and picking at each step a split that maximises the information gain about the labels. After each splitting this process is repeated, and thus the final structure is that of a tree -- thus the name. Decision trees however have a tendency to overfit the data, and the purpose of the Random Forests algorithm is to reduce that problem. Random forests is an ensemble method that works by introducing randomness into a Decision Tree. It creates a number of different decision trees, built from random smaples and selecting a random subset of the features at each split rather than the full set of features. The final prediction is given by the average prediction of this forest of trees, resulting in less overfitting as compared to a single decision tree.\n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**?\n",

    "**Answer:** Some of the features I had predicted are among these, namely education-num and capital-gain. However, I did not foresee the most predictive of all, which is marital status. This is of course closely related to relationship_Husband, the fourth most predictive feature. I also didn't mention age, which is the fifth most predictive, and which is of course expected to be positively correlated with income. \n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight, marital status makes sense since we only want to be able to predict whether the person makes more or less than 50k, and this is a value which is perhaps around the threshold of being able to maintain a family comfortably. A possible explanation for this feature's importance is perhaps that those who are able to maintain a family comfortably are more desirable marriage partners, and therefore are more likely to attract a partner for marriage. Also, perhaps married people are more likely to have the incentive to gain above this threshold compared to non-married people, as they have a family to sustain."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** the final model's F-score was reduced from 0.7348 to 0.6941 -- a 5.5% reduction, and still better than the unoptimised model on the full data. This relatively small loss could be compensated by significantly faster training time. If training time was an important factor in a given problem, I would therefore consider using a similarly reduced data as my training set. How many features to consider in the final model of course would depend on the details of the specific problem, and the relative importance of speed vs f-score."
